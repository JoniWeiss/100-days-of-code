# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 0: January 1, 2017
**Thoughts** Start of log.

### Day 1: January 2, 2017
**Thoughts** To start things off, I'm creating a new project which will replace my portfolio site. My new portfolio will:
* Use Bootstrap and some FlexBox for layout,
* Be built using ReactJS, React Router, and possibly a DB.
* Will include a __resume page__ for the landing/home page and with links to projects on a __portfolio__ page. I will integrate my __Medium.com Blog__, and a __Contacts__ section. That's the plan as of right now. That could change :)

**Today's Progress**: Created repo and cloned locally. Built webpack configuration and basic file structure. Created index.html, index.js, and App.js. Not much actual coding today.

### Day 2: January 3, 2017
**Thoughts** Creating skeleton for a game of poker. This is a game used for teaching basic javascript in the browser environment. This game will be paired with java code which contains the game logic.

**Today's Progress**: Created repo and cloned locally. Created files and structure. Created basic html page and css. Created some basic JS to make sure everything works.
