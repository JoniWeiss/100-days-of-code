# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2017
**Thoughts** To start things off, I'm creating a new project which will replace my portfolio site. My new portfolio will:
* Use Bootstrap and some FlexBox for layout,
* Be built using ReactJS, React Router, and possibly a DB.
* Will include a __resume page__ for the landing/home page and with links to projects on a __portfolio__ page. I will integrate my __Medium.com Blog__, and a __Contacts__ section. That's the plan as of right now. That could change :)

**Today's Progress**: Created repo and cloned locally. Built webpack configuration and basic file structure. Created index.html, index.js, and App.js. Not much actual coding today.
